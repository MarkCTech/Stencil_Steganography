# Stencil_Steganography  
## Summary  
This was an exercise in working with images in Python, using the Pillow library.  

Steganography is the art of hiding a message inside some media. In this very basic example a stencil with a few holes is placed over a large table of words, revealing a hidden message.  

## Using the program
Running the .PY in your IDE will open the 2 .PNGs in the /images folder, the program will resize, make translucent and then overlay the Mask image over the Word Matrix. This new image is then saved to the same /images folder.
